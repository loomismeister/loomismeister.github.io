<!-- Today's programmers are often asked during interviews to demonstrate their skills at implementing algorithms. This [Airbnb](https://youtu.be/cdCeU8DJvPM) technical interview is typical, reverse a string and answer questions about its time and space complexity. I believe these questions are so irrelevant that they should probably not be asked. Its asking a question about knowledge, something that is meaningless for any job of real value. -->
<!-- What should an interviewer be interested in learning during an interview? 
- How do they solve problems they don't yet know how to solve. 
- How do they react towards being challenged with impossible tasks.
- Do they have a portfolio of usable products or libraries? -->
