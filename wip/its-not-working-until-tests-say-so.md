<!-- Some people online often wonder if TDD is worth the effort. I want to talk about how I think development with tests works in practice, which is not really ever pure TDD. Also talk about how features shouldn't be considered 'done' until tests cover its functionality, and how having tests for projects actually dramatically increases developement speed. -->
